/**
 * These flags are used by {@code JNADominoCollection#findByKey(Set, Object...)}
 * (NIFFindByKey)
 * and NIFFindByName to control how the
 * view is searched for the key. The flags, {@link #PARTIAL},
 * {@link #CASE_INSENSITIVE},
 * and {@link #ACCENT_INSENSITIVE} should only be used for character data, since
 * a
 * "partial number" or "partial date" is not well defined.<br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link #LESS_THAN} and {@link #GREATER_THAN} flags refer to the way the
 * sorted
 * column keys are ordered and displayed, not the way they compare with each
 * other. {@link #LESS_THAN} means "find the entry before" and
 * {@link #GREATER_THAN}
 * means "find the entry after" a desired key. The {@link #LESS_THAN} and
 * {@link #GREATER_THAN} flags will result in success if at least one key that
 * is less than or greater than the specified key, respectively, is found.<br>
 * <br>
 * If a {@link #FIRST_EQUAL} or {@link #LAST_EQUAL} comparison is specified and
 * the
 * number of matches is requested to be returned, then the number of entries
 * which match the specified key will be returned. If a {@link #LESS_THAN} or
 * {@link #GREATER_THAN} comparison is specified, then the number of matching
 * entries cannot be requested.
